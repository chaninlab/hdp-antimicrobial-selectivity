# 1. Evaluation Metrics:
# I will calculate the Evaluation metrics such as OOB score, Recall score and Kappa score using the whole dataset.
# I will be changing the seed of Random Forest Classifier along with the loop. The values of seed starts from 123
# and goes up to 148 which will also be the range of Iteration of the loop which is 25 Iterations in total.

# Now, I will calculate the mean of each rows which will be the mean of Importances of each Attributes or Features.
# Then I will create the new column called "Average" in the DataFrame which will store the mean of each Attributes or
# Features and I will sort the DataFrame according to this column in ascending order.
